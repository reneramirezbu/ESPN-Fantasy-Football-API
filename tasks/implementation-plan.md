# Weekly Rankings XLSX Upload - Implementation Plan & Status

## Project Overview
A lightweight POC system for uploading and managing weekly fantasy football rankings from XLSX files. Designed for personal use (few minutes per week) with file-based storage instead of a database.

## Current Status: Phase 2.5 ✅ COMPLETE

### What's Been Built

#### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure ✅
- **XLSX Parser Service** (`services/xlsxParser.js`)
  - Multi-tab parsing (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, DST, K)
  - Column normalization and validation
  - Team abbreviation mapping
  - Player name cleaning

- **Name Matching Service** (`services/nameMatch.js`)
  - Fuzzy matching using Fuse.js
  - Confidence scoring system
  - Manual mapping persistence
  - Atomic file operations for data integrity

- **Rankings API** (`api/rankings.js`)
  - Upload endpoint with file validation
  - CRUD operations for rankings
  - Player matching with ESPN rosters
  - Comparison between weeks

- **Express Server** (`server-express.js`)
  - Integrated with existing ESPN API
  - Input validation middleware
  - Rate limiting and CORS
  - Security hardening applied

- **Test Interface** (`public/upload-test.html`)
  - Drag-and-drop upload
  - Rankings viewer
  - Status tracking

#### Phase 2: React Frontend ✅
- Full React application with Material-UI
- Drag-and-drop file upload with react-dropzone
- Sortable/filterable rankings table
- Week/season navigation
- Context API for state management
- Running on http://localhost:3000

#### Phase 2.5: ESPN Integration ✅
- ESPN roster data integrated into React app
- Team statistics component
- Player rankings shown alongside roster
- Unified data context for both rankings and roster
- Foundation ready for optimizer functionality

### Security Fixes Applied
✅ Path traversal vulnerability fixed
✅ File upload security enhanced
✅ JSON parsing validation added
✅ Input validation middleware implemented
✅ Atomic file operations for data integrity

### How to Use

#### Backend Server (Express)
1. Start server: `node server-express.js` (runs on port 3001)
2. Old HTML interface: http://localhost:3001/upload-test.html

#### React Frontend (Recommended)
1. Start React app: `cd client && npm start` (runs on port 3000)
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000
3. Features:
   - **My Team**: View ESPN roster with rankings
   - **Rankings**: View/filter uploaded rankings
   - **Upload**: Drag-and-drop XLSX files
   - **Compare**: Week comparison (future)

### Test Data
- Generator: `node test-rankings-generator.js`
- Sample file: `data/uploads/test-rankings.xlsx`
- Stored rankings: `data/rankings/2024-week15.json`

---

## Phase 2: React Frontend ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed Time**: 2 hours

### Completed Components
- ✅ `client/src/components/FileUpload.jsx` - Drag-and-drop interface with Material-UI
- ✅ `client/src/components/RankingsTable.jsx` - Sortable/filterable table with position tabs
- ✅ `client/src/components/NameResolver.jsx` - Manual name matching dialog
- ✅ `client/src/components/WeekSelector.jsx` - Week/season navigation with availability indicators
- ✅ `client/src/context/RankingsContext.js` - Global state management with Context API
- ✅ `client/src/services/api.js` - API service layer
- ✅ `client/src/App.js` - Main app with navigation and theming

### Implementation Details
- Material-UI for consistent design
- react-dropzone for file uploads
- Context API for state management
- Proxy configured for Express backend integration
- Running on http://localhost:3000

---

## Phase 2.5: ESPN Integration into React App ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed Time**: 30 minutes

### Purpose
The optimizer feature requires both rankings data AND ESPN roster data in the same application.
Integrating the ESPN dashboard into the React app is a prerequisite for the optimizer.

### Components Completed
- ✅ `client/src/components/MyTeam.jsx` - Displays ESPN roster with rankings integration
- ✅ `client/src/components/TeamStats.jsx` - Shows team record, points for/against
- ✅ Updated `client/src/services/api.js` - Added ESPN roster fetching methods
- ✅ Updated `client/src/context/RankingsContext.js` - Includes roster data alongside rankings
- ✅ Updated `client/src/App.js` - Added "My Team" navigation option

### Key Features Implemented
- ESPN roster display with player details, injury status, positions
- Team statistics showing wins/losses/points
- Integration showing weekly rankings next to roster players
- Automatic matching between uploaded rankings and ESPN roster
- Refresh functionality to update roster data

### Why This Phase is Critical
- Optimizer needs access to BOTH rankings and roster data
- Having separate apps makes optimization impossible
- Unified interface improves user experience
- Enables all Phase 3 features to work properly

---

## Phase 3: Optimization Features (NOT STARTED)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Prerequisite**: Phase 2.5 must be complete

### Lineup Optimizer
- Algorithm to fill roster slots by rank
- Handle FLEX position properly
- Filter OUT/Bye players
- Integrate with ESPN roster data (from Phase 2.5)

### Waiver Wire Analysis
- Compare free agents to bench players
- Rank differential scoring
- Add/drop recommendations
- Top 5-10 suggestions

### Services to Create
- `services/optimizer.js` - Lineup optimization logic
- `services/waiverAnalysis.js` - Waiver suggestions

---

## Phase 4: Future Enhancements (OPTIONAL)

### ROS (Rest of Season) Rankings
- Additional upload for season-long rankings
- Tie-breaking for lineup optimizer
- Enhanced waiver recommendations

### Advanced Features
- Projections integration
- Trade analyzer
- Schedule strength analysis
- Historical performance tracking

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "multer": "^2.0.2",      // File uploads
  "xlsx": "^0.18.5",       // XLSX parsing
  "fuse.js": "^7.1.0",     // Fuzzy matching
  "express": "^5.1.0",     // Web framework
  "cors": "^2.8.5",        // CORS support
  "body-parser": "^2.2.0"  // Request parsing
}
```

### Data Formats

#### Rankings JSON Structure
```json
{
  "week": 15,
  "season": 2024,
  "uploadedAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "positions": {
    "QB": [
      {"rank": 1, "name": "Josh Allen", "team": "BUF", "tier": 1}
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "totalPlayers": 35,
    "sheetsProcessed": ["QB", "RB", "WR"],
    "errors": [],
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

#### Name Mappings JSON
```json
{
  "player_key": {
    "espnId": 123456,
    "espnName": "Official Name",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "method": "fuzzy_match"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
Using `.env.local`:
- `LEAGUE1_ID` - ESPN League ID
- `LEAGUE1_TEAM_ID` - Your team ID
- `LEAGUE1_ESPN_S2` - ESPN auth cookie
- `LEAGUE1_SWID` - ESPN SWID cookie

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Unit Tests**: Parser functions, name matching algorithm
2. **Integration Tests**: Upload workflow, API endpoints
3. **Edge Cases**: Invalid files, special characters, duplicates
4. **Performance**: Large files (500+ players)

### Known Limitations
- No database (file-based storage)
- Single league support
- No real-time updates
- Manual XLSX upload only
- No automated ESPN sync

### Next Session Starting Points
1. **For Optimizer**: Start with Phase 3 - both rankings and roster data are now integrated
2. **For Production**: Add database, user auth, multi-league support
3. **For Enhanced Features**: Phase 4 - ROS rankings, trade analyzer, etc.
